IntentFlow is a plug-and-play AI personalization widget that any website can install in under 5 minutes via a single script tag. It detects visitor intent from 7 context signals — URL parameters, UTM tags, referrer analysis, on-page behavior, device type, time of day, and screen size — and instantly personalizes the hero section with the optimal template, imagery, headline, and call-to-action from a curated registry of finite, safe variants.

Unlike enterprise personalization tools that cost $50K+ and require analytics teams, IntentFlow is designed for the long tail: Shopify stores, Webflow sites, and custom websites that run the same static homepage for every visitor. The entire decision engine runs client-side with zero dependencies, no API calls, and no latency.

The technical core is threefold. First, an explainable decision engine that outputs structured JSON documenting which signals were detected, what confidence was assigned, which template was selected, and why. Second, a real-time context observer that watches scroll velocity, click patterns, hover dwell, and section visibility via IntersectionObserver — and re-personalizes the hero mid-session when behavioral signals shift. Third, a conversion analytics dashboard visualizing the personalization funnel, intent distribution, signal breakdown, and projected ROI.

IntentFlow ships with 3 hero templates (Impact, Comparison, Value), 6 curated hero images, and 5 content variants mapped to distinct visitor intents: Buy Now, Compare, Use Case, Budget, and Default. Additional features include A/B exploration with automatic winner selection, multi-page support for homepage, product, category, and landing pages, a debug overlay for developers, a preview mode for site owners, and lightweight event tracking.

The demo showcases an e-commerce monitor store where visitors arriving with different intents see completely different hero experiences — all powered by a single script tag with safe fallback to default content.
