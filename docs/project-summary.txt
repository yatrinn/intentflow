IntentFlow is a plug-and-play AI personalization widget that any website can install in under 5 minutes via a single script tag. It detects visitor intent from context signals — URL parameters, UTM tags, referrer analysis, and on-page behavior — and instantly personalizes the hero section with the optimal template, imagery, headline, and call-to-action from a curated registry of finite, safe variants.

Unlike enterprise personalization tools that cost thousands and require analytics teams, IntentFlow is designed for the long tail: Shopify stores, Webflow sites, and custom websites that run the same static homepage for every visitor. The system requires zero backend infrastructure — the entire decision engine runs client-side in the browser with no API calls and no latency.

The core innovation is the explainable decision engine: every personalization choice produces a structured JSON object documenting which signals were detected, what confidence score was assigned, which template was selected, and why. This transparency builds trust for site owners who need to understand what's happening on their pages.

IntentFlow ships with three hero templates (Impact, Comparison, Value), six curated hero images, and five complete content variants mapped to distinct visitor intents: Buy Now, Compare, Use Case, Budget, and Default. The system includes a debug overlay for developers, a preview mode for site owners to simulate intents, and lightweight event tracking for CTA clicks and impressions.

The demo showcases an e-commerce monitor store where visitors arriving with different intents (e.g., "buy 4K monitor" vs. "best monitor comparison") see completely different hero experiences — all powered by a single script tag with safe fallback to default content.
